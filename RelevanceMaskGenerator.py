    Creates a binary mask for each batch of 2D points based on two geometric conditions.

    Parameters:
    - points (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B, N, 2) representing B batches of N 2D points.
    - start_indices (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape (B,) representing the index of the start point in each batch.

    - mask (torch.Tensor): Binary mask of shape (B, N) where each element is 1 if the corresponding point satisfies either:
        a) Squared distance from the start point is >= distance from start to end.
        b) Lies on or on the side of the separating line (perpendicular to the start-end line at the start point) that does not include the end point.
